## _TERMINAL

This is a game developed by [@brandy12](https://github.com/brandy12), [@erzloh](https://github.com/erzloh), and me, with Richard Holzer as artist.
It was made for the [Global Game Jam Geneva 2023](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/jam-sites/global-game-jam-geneva), in 48 hours.
Out team members either had none or almost no experience in Godot, and we are very happy with what we could learn over this long weekend.


The theme of the jam was the word "root". In this game, the user controls a mouse pointer in the terminal, looking for the root folder.
You can play the game in your browser [here](https://lillich.itch.io/terminal). If you want to feel more like a hacker (besides the \*perfect* game immersion itself), try to look for cheat codes in the source code :) .
